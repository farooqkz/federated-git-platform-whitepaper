# WhitePaper

This repository is intended to discuss and brainstorm regarding the concept of the distributed decentralized Git platform.
Ultimately the outcome of this repository will be a WhitePaper explaining the principles and general standards of a Git platform that is decentralized and distributed over multiple nodes.


## General Description

This Git repository is trying to continue what we have started in [a github repository](https://github.com/1995parham/github-do-not-ban-us). In that repository there were lots of ideas and many discussions, but the repository owner unfortunately decided to put the repository in read-only mode without providing any information on why.

On the up-side, we (public) can still access [the "issues"](https://github.com/1995parham/github-do-not-ban-us/issues) of that git repository. Among these posted "issues", some of them were tagged by the repository owner as "proposal" from which [three of them left open](https://github.com/1995parham/github-do-not-ban-us/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aproposal). The following are the titles:

- [Would you use a NEW non-profit, sanction-free platform?](https://github.com/1995parham/github-do-not-ban-us/issues/1375)
- [Abandon GitHub](https://github.com/1995parham/github-do-not-ban-us/issues/926)
- [We have to federate git hosting services, asap](https://github.com/1995parham/github-do-not-ban-us/issues/629)

From these three, [the last one was interesting](https://web.archive.org/web/20190802161718/https://github.com/1995parham/github-do-not-ban-us/issues/629) for us to discuss further and build on top of.


## Contribution Guideline

There are so many topics to be discussed regarding this matter. Therefore we thought to have some general guideline on how everyone can contribute in the process. The following are what we came up with:

1. If you have an idea, please search among the issues and just post a new issue if you really don't find anything related (remember to search the closed issues as well)
2. This is not a place to discuss political agenda, therefore please avoid posting them.
3. It would be useful to everyone if you provide example when you are proposing an idea. Typically you can find a concept similar, but perhaps not identical, to yours. It woould be good if you can reference them in your text and explain what is the differences and similarities between your idea and the one you referenced.
4. If you see any typos, create a pull-request.
5. If you can explain a concept better than the way that is already explained in the text, go for it. Change the text (one concept at a time) and create pull-request.
